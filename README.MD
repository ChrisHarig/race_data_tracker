### Outline

Record and store the following data from a swim race manually:
- Reaction time
- Each breakout time
- Each breakout distance
- Time to 15 
- Time at which each stroke occured 
- Number of strokes each lap
- Turn start and end times 
    - This will also act as lap time 
    - For flip turns (free and back events), the turn start and end will be the same
- Race end time

From the above, derive:
- Time spent underwater each lap
- Average time spent underwater
- Average stroke count
- Average turn time
- Average time to 15 
- Average breakout distance
- Average breakout time

Produce:
- A table with times of each segment (reaction time,breakout (with distance listed), 15m and lap)
    - Times should add up to the total race time
- A graph of tempo time
- A graph of stroke count over time
- A table with other stats such as average turn time, average breakout distance etc.

All of this will be stored in a pdf with the swimmers name and the race details.

### Functionality
Ability to record data via clicking the space bar when any of the following occurs:
- The start 
- The breakout 
- A stroke is completed
- When the turn starts and ends
- When the race ends

15m or any other points of interest will have to be manually entered afterwards, as it will be difficult to differentiate between a stroke occuring and the 15m click occuring.
Strokes per lap will have to be manually entered as well. 

Given the strokes per lap, the race can be segmented after the race data is recorded via keyboard clicks.
